Discuss the following in your reflection:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

I always thought that user experience and usability were the same thing. Now I see that user experience is more of the feelings that a user has, whereas usability is how easy/efficient it is for a user to traverse the site. They are definetly closely related, but they are not the same.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

I do like design and user experience, but I know that I don't always agree with people about how to do either one. I liked working on the site. Origionally I had the items as menu items in the header, but there were getting to be too many, so I played around with different wireframe to see how I could display them all. I like the design I chose because it also worked well for practicing responsive design. 

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

First I wireframed, trying to fix the biggest problem: how to display all of the links neatly. Once I decided on a solution I started coding. The sizes of things in percentages or ems was basically a guess and check part, I miss the simplicity of a fixed site, even though I know responsive it much better. There were a few items that I had problems with, so I was happy that I didn't need to stick to the wireframe and I was able to come up with alternate solutions. For instance, origionally the lines below the links were above the links. But as I changed the browsers size, some link names are longer and would be displayed on two lines, making all of the orange lines uneven. Now that they're on the bottom, it doesn't matter!

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

I still can't quite get the footer to stay at the bottom all the time. I kept thinking that I got it to work, but then when I tried a browser at a mobile size, it would jump up. I'm working on it.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

Overall, I was just so surprised how easy it was for me to impliment the responsive design, though my site is far from perfect. I really thought it would be much more difficult and technical. 


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
