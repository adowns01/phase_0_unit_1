## 5. Web Standards

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

Yes. I like it when things are consistent and web standards especially help when trying to read someone else's code. Though I could understand an argument if someone said they are limiting, I ultimately think they are good and help everyone. 

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

I love how intuitive HTML structure is. All opening tags need end tags (well...except some, like img) and all tags should be nestled like matryoshka dolls. There is a beautiful simplicity to it.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

I had actually never heard of them until this lesson. I think I will need to get used to using them (currently I have a terrible case of div-itis), but I like the idea. I think it will make my code much easier to read and more intuitive. 

* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

At work it is my job to test websites on different browsers (and their versions) and devices. I only test sites in Chrome, Safari, IE, and Opera. For my everyday life I only use Chrome. Sites can look *so* different in different browsers. IE 8 and lower are the bane of my existance. I think everyone should have a choice of what browser they use, but for website building purposes, I really wish everyone would just use the latest version of chrome.  

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I did this section while pairing with Ronald. I recommend him as a resource, he seems to know a good link for everything.
