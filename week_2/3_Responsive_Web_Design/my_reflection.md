## 6. Responsive Web Design
* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Responsive design is used to make sure websites are optimized for many resolutions without having to make seperate sites for different devices. I do like responsive design; I get frustraited when sites don't have it and I have to scroll unnecessarily. I even wish this page did it better. I often like looking at two pages at once, and I like it when the text wraps. 
Responsive design is the best practice because there are so many screen sizes out there; there is no way to specifically change your site for each one. 

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

Because there are so many different types and sizes of smartphones and tablets, websites now need to not only look good, but also work well at all sizes. Because of this, modern websites (should) take these things into account. We have gone away from the days where companies have a seperate computer and mobile site and onto the days of responsive design. 

I can't even pretend to guess what technology will be in the future, but I hope that web designs will continue being more streamlined and more intuitive. Soon websites might need to be optimized for google glass or other crazy sizes that will bring their own restraints. 

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

I have never thought about this before. My guess is that they have something like Siri that reads it alloud to them. I could see a situation though with a poorly laid out website where "siri" is reading a long menu, or unimportant information rather than the important things because of how the website was coded. I don't think that the visually-impaired is my largest audience, so I wouldn't design a website just for them, (unless the website was for them!), but if there were guidliness for making it easier for the visually impaired, then I think we would design with those in mind.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

I work in a web development firm so I hear about responsive design a lot and part of my job is testing sites on as many browsers/devices/resolutions/etc to test the responsive design. However, I never realized how easy it is to code (the basics at least, to make a large site look great on as many things as possible takes a lot of work). I thought I would have to download many things, and I thought the coding would look way more intimidating. I was so excited when I got my page working!

I am having problems with lining things up in a container. For instance, if I make three boxes have a width of 33% they should all fit, but if I add padding, the don't anymore. I understand why, but it's just frustraiting and I wish padding was included in the width. I'm sure there is a very logical reason why it isn't, but I haven't found it yet.
