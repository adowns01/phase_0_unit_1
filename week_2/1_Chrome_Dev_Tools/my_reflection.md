# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
A DOM (Document Object Model) is a way to interact with the browsers. I had used some during phase 0 prep when I was messing around with js, but I never knew that this is what is was called. It makes since that other things should be able to link to the HTML page and change it. For instance, I have made a countdown until DBC clock and it updates the page every second using js. I read that DOM needed can change per browser. I'm not quite sure how the DOM changes or how to impliment multiple DOMs so a site can be viewed optimally on multiple pages.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
Mine is much less detailed (as expected). I was shocked that there were no comments on their site.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
I have used "inspect element" for awhile for multiple reasons, usually to look at the size of an image or a filename, but I had never delved deeper into Chrome Web Tools; I had never even heard the phrase "Chrome Web Tools". I found them very helpful, though I know I don't understand everything about them yet. I really liked the "Network" tab where you can see how long everything takes to load and the order things load. I plan to start using the "elements" tab to toggle css elements on and off next time I have problems. I know that will be much faster than making a small change, saving, relading the page, trying to remember what the page looked like before, etc.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
I'm understanding better how Git/GitHub works and how to use it. Especially how it saves just little bits of code versions, instead of the whole file.

* I had never heard of "minify-ing" before. It makes sense that taking out all the spaces makes the page load faster, especially if the files are large, but the aesthetic side of me dies a little inside when I look at code that has been minify-ed.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I used www.w3schools.com/ to check syntax when I was unsure and to look up how to open a link in a new window.
