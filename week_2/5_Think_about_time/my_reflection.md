# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

*What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?

Time management is actually something I am very good at, especially if it is something that I want to do, like DBC prep. My biggest problem is that sometimes after I get home from work, if I don’t start working on prep right away it can be hard to get into it at all. 

*How will you combat that?

Basically, I set an alarm so I give myself 30 minutes free to do whatever I want when I get home. When my alarm goes off, I have to start prep. So far it’s worked well. I really just have to get started, because once I start then I find it enjoyable and it’s easy to finish a days worth of work.

*What techniques will you try?

One of my favorite techniques is the Pomodoro Technique, though I had no idea it was called that. However, if I am in the zone and feeling good I skip the breaks. I am also looking forward to the yoga during the day at dev bootcamp. Stretching always helps me refocus. 

*What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

Stay on schedule, take notes, and keep talking to my accountability group.
